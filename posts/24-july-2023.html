        <p>MEMORISE: “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets” – Hebrews 1:1 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: Hebrews 1:1-2 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</p>
        
        <p>2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>Yesterday, we started discussing the reality of God still speaking to His people, even to this present moment. In today’s text, we read that though God spoke to His people through His prophets, now He speaks through His Son, Jesus Christ. This is made possible through the Holy Spirit whom Jesus sent to the Church right from the day of Pentecost. He promised:</p>
        
        <p>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. – John 14:26</p>
        
        <p>God still speaks to His people; no doubt about that. We must however, pay close attention to the later part of the sentence – “to His people”. In other words, God speaks only to His people. Why only His people? It is because it is His people who hearken and act on His words. God has no time to waste talking to those who will not do His bidding. This is why Jesus Christ was fond of speaking to His disciples, whom He knew would abide by His words. He said further:</p>
        
        <p>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. – John 14:21</p>
        
        <p>Beloved, there are a lot of blessings for those who hear from God. One of these blessings is that such people would avoid mistakes. For example, the word of God to the people in Cornelius’ household was based on Peter’s ability to hear from God and his obedience to the instructions given to him (Acts 10). In the same vein, Philip’s ability to hear from God took him to the Gazan desert where he gained the soul of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:26-39).</p>
        
        <p>For example, hearing from God can reveal the type of business you can do to prosper. It can also help you know where to go, live, or what type of friends you should keep. If you desire to hear from God directly, you must give your life to Christ and live wholly for Him.</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Have you been hearkening and living according to His words?</p>
