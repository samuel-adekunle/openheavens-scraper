        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>One of my sons while preaching some time said Jacob laboured for 14 years to get the woman he wanted to marry (Genesis 29:18-30) while Isaac simply took a stroll and came back with a wife (Genesis 24:63-67). One had favour, the other exerted labour. The moment he said that, I made up my mind that l am going to enjoy God’s favour in every area of my life. This decision led me to make what you will probably call ‘New Year resolutions’. These resolutions are deliberate steps I will take towards basking in divine favour for the rest of my life. l am going to share these steps with you over the next six days and I want to encourage you to take them very seriously. Please do not treat them like the typical New Year resolutions that are often quickly forgotten in the course of the year.</p>
        
        <p>This year, like never before, I am determined to praise and worship God with all my heart and strength. Whenever you eulogise someone from the bottom of your heart, you can get that fellow to volunteer to help you. I will worship and praise God so much that He will volunteer to help me like He did for Paul and Silas in Acts 16:25-26.</p>
        
        <p>My biological father was so poor that whenever the time came for school fees to be paid, he will pick quarrels with his two wives so that they wouldn’t be able to ask for the children’s school fees. However, my mother knew how to get my school fees. She would go into my father’s room and eulogize him to the extent that he would ask her, “What can I do for you today?” My mother would promptly ask for my school fees and he would immediately promise to see to it that my school fees are paid.</p>
        
        <p>This year, I am going to praise and worship God more than ever before. Like David who also enjoyed divine favour all through his life, I will bless God at all times and His praise shall continually be in my mouth (Psalm 34:1). I will never stop praising His holy name. I will be intentional in praising Him at all times. I will praise Him with everything within me (Psalm 103:1). I will speak of His greatness at all times and He will cover me specially with His favour all through this year and beyond. I will praise my God forever (Psalm 145:1-2). What about you?</p>
        
        <h2>Action Point</h2>
        <p>Spend quality time praising God today and make this a daily practice going forward.</p>
