        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.” – John 15:2 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: John 15:1-5 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</p>
        
        <p>2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</p>
        
        <p>3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</p>
        
        <p>4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</p>
        
        <p>5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>One thing about being one of God’s best friends is that you must be ready to be pruned. God’s best friends are fruit-bearers; that is why He said in John 15:16 that if you bear fruits and those fruits abide, you can ask anything of Him, and He will do it.</p>
        
        <p>God will prune you till you are genuinely humble. He will prune you till you are completely dead to the flesh. Once He marks you as someone to bring closer to Himself, He will start pruning you. This is where many people drop off His friends list because they cannot endure His pruning.</p>
        
        <p>Many years ago, I was at an airport, and I was to declare all the money that I had with me. I only told the attendant about the notes and left out the coins. She told me to show her my purse, and I was embarrassed because I had to admit I had lied. The lady let it go, but I heard God’s voice at that moment, “You are special to me, so I will not condone the smallest of lies from you.” If you really want to be one of God’s best friends, you must be ready to meet His high standards.</p>
        
        <p>Nobody can get close to God without going through intense discipline. You must be willing to submit to His discipline if you want to become His best friend. If God disciplines a person for doing something wrong and the person does not desist from committing that particular sin, He will eventually leave such a person as He cannot become friends with unrepentant people.</p>
        
        <p>Once in a while, God tests His best friends. He takes them through a period of trials to prune them and make them perfect, wanting nothing (James 1:3-4). Only a few people go through these trials and come out on the other side perfect. Only a few people can submit to these tests without compromising their faith. Are you one of those people?</p>
        
        <p>Beloved, it is true that divine pruning can be a painful exercise, so you must spend quality time in God’s presence daily to build your spiritual strength. If you hold on and do not give up, you will not only become more fruitful, but you will also become one of God’s best friends.</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Are you willing to be pruned by God so you can get closer to Him and produce more fruit?</p>
