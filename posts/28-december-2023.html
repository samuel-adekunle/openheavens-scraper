        <p>
            <strong>READ: Matthew 23:1-7 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</p>
        
        <p>2 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:</p>
        
        <p>3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</p>
        
        <p>4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</p>
        
        <p>5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</p>
        
        <p>6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</p>
        
        <p>7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</p>
