        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” – Proverbs 4:18 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: 1 Samuel 2:7-9 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>7 The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p>
        
        <p>8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and he hath set the world upon them.</p>
        
        <p>9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>It doesn’t matter how low you are now, there is still hope for a great future. I have seen God lift people from the miry clay and take them to the mountain top. Believe it or not, He will do the same for you, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <p>My story is proof of this; I walked barefoot for the first eighteen years of my life. I can never forget my final year in grammar school. Prize-Giving day was coming up and I was supposed to take home many prizes. Those of us in our final year were to wear white trousers and shoes but I had no trousers – white, black or red. As for shoes, I had never owned one. I started lamenting, “God, you know I have no trousers; why did You allow me to win these prizes?” One day, a boy in the hostel asked me to help him choose which of his six trousers he should wear for the ceremony. I helped him choose one and then said, “Ermm, you know I don’t even have one to wear”. “Pick one,” he offered. Although the trouser was so big that I nearly had to pull the waistband up to my chest, I didn’t care; trousers were trousers.</p>
        
        <p>Now, the next problem was shoes. It was then I remembered that I had a poor uncle somewhere who had some shoes. The pair he gave me was old, with soles made from old lorry tires. I had to practice walking in them because I had never worn shoes before in my life. However, when the Prize-Giving day finally came, I had trousers and shoes to wear to the occasion.</p>
        
        <p>Even if your current situation is worse than what I have just described, I assure you that the Lord who lifted me up can do the same for you. Greater days are coming, if you trust God and lay all in His hands. I must say that God did not raise me just because He felt like doing so; He did it to show forth His own glory. He said when your light shines before men, it is so that they can glorify your Father in heaven (Matthew 5:16).</p>
        
        <p>If you dedicate your life to glorifying Him and are never shy to give Him glory for whatever you achieve, He will raise you, even higher than you can ever imagine.</p>
        
        <p>Greater days are ahead of you, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Anyone who is willing to glorify God with his or her life will experience divine lifting.</p>

            <strong>Open Heaven 1 August 2023 HYMN 14: O What A Wonderful, Wonderful Day</strong>
        </p>
        
        
        <p>1 O what a wonderful, wonderful day,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Day I will never forget;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>After I’d wandered in darkness away,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Jesus my Saviour I met.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>O what a tender, compassionate friend</p>
        
        
        
        <p>He met the need of my heart;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>He made all the darkness depart!</p>
        
        
        
        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>Refrain:</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Heaven came down and glory fill my soul,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>When at the cross my Saviour made me whole;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>My sins were washed away</p>
        
        
        
        <p>And my night was tuned to day</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Heaven came down and glory filled my soul!</p>
        
        
        
        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>2 Born of the Spirit with life from above</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Into God’s family divine,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Justified fully thru Calvary’s love,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>O what a standing is mine!</p>
        
        
        
        <p>And the transaction so quickly was made</p>
        
        
        
        <p>When as a sinner I came,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Took of the offer of grace He did proffer</p>
        
        
        
        <p>He saved me, O praise His dear name!</p>
        
        
        
        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>3 Now I’ve a hope that will surely endure</p>
        
        
        
        <p>After the passing of time;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>I have a future in heaven for sure,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>There in those mansions sublime.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>And it’s because of that wonderful day</p>
        
        
        
        <p>When at the cross I believed;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Riches eternal and blessings supernal</p>
        
        
        
        <p>From His precious hand I received.</p>
