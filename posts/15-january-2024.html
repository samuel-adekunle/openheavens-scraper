        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.” – Joel 2:25 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: 1 Samuel 30:1-8, 18-19 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>1 Samuel 30:1-81 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</p>
        
        <p>2 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.</p>
        
        <p>3 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</p>
        
        <p>4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</p>
        
        <p>5 And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</p>
        
        <p>6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</p>
        
        <p>7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</p>
        
        <p>8 And David enquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.</p>
        
        <p>1 Samuel 30:18-1918 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.</p>
        
        <p>19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>Today, I will conclude the discussion about God’s prophetic message to you from Isaiah 3:10 that says it shall be well with the righteous in this new year and beyond. God indeed desires that you should enjoy all-round wellness, and this includes recovering all that you might have lost to the enemy. I declare that you will recover all that you may have lost to the enemy, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <p>Our Father in heaven said in His words, “I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:” (Isaiah 45:2). In other words, the Lord is assuring us of His presence as we pass through this new year. Our Lord Jesus Christ gave us an added assurance in John 16:33:</p>
        
        <p>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>
        
        <p>These infallible words in the Scriptures are an assurance to you that regardless of what you might have experienced in the last year, it shall be well with you in this new year.</p>
        
        <p>Beloved, for it to be well with you this year, you must learn a lesson from our Bible text for today. David consulted God before pursuing the enemy, and God assured him of victory. I encourage you to cultivate the habit of seeking divine direction this year as you go about all your lawful endeavours. David, even though He was an army General of high repute, did not rush into pursuing those who raided his camp while he was away. Instead, he consulted with his Commander-In-Chief, Jehovah-Nissi, for divine assurance. God told him to pursue after the invaders, and when he did, he recovered all that they had stolen from him.</p>
        
        <p>Are there things you know that the devil has stolen from you? Are there opportunities you believe you have lost? Are there steps you ought to have taken but failed to, and you feel all is over? I want to assure you today that my God can help you recover all if you trust Him and surrender all to Him.</p>
        
        <p>I declare once again that as you truly surrender all to Jesus and seek His guidance, you will recover all the losses you may have suffered, and it shall be well with you, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Thank God for His assurance of recovering all, and ask Him to recover all your losses for you, in Jesus’ name.</p>

        <p>Resting in my Savior as my All in all,</p>
