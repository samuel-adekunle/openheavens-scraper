*Open Heaven 16 September 2023 TOPIC: The Most High 1*

*MEMORY VERSE*
MEMORISE: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.” – Psalm 91:1 (KJV)

*BIBLE READING*
READ: Psalm 47:1-9 (KJV)

O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.

2 For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.

3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

5 God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.

6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.

7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.

8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.

9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

*MESSAGE*
Our God is the Most High (Ecclesiastes 5:8). Jesus’ name is higher than every other (Philippians 2:9), and this means all the problems you are currently facing are below Him. Every now and then, you need to shout the name JESUS so that your problem will hear it and flee. His throne is higher than any other because it is in the heavens, far above all principalities and powers. His army is bigger and stronger than any other because He controls all the hosts in heaven, on earth and underneath the earth. According to Philippians 2:9-11, not only is His name higher than any other, His influence is also in all the spheres because, in Heaven, on earth and underneath the earth, knees bow to Him. The fact that God is the Most High however, has certain implications. We will begin to discuss this today and over the next few days.

Firstly, being the Most High, He has the last say over every matter. If you have a case in a High Court and the judge finds you guilty, you can appeal the ruling. If the Appeal Court says you are guilty, you can appeal to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court says you are guilty, the President may decide to grant you a state pardon. There is however, somebody higher than the President and that is the Almighty God. He is not a President, a Prime Minister, or a King. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. He is the King who decrees a thing and it stands fast (Psalm 33:9).

And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. – Matthew 10:28

In Exodus 5:1-2, the world’s greatest ruler then was Pharaoh. Moses relayed God’s message to him saying, “Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness”. Pharaoh refused and said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go?” By the time God had finished with him, he was the one begging the people to go. If you disobey God, it means you love death (Proverbs 8:36). If you have any wisdom, you will fear the Most High and stay away from anything that can offend Him.

*PRAYER POINT*
If you have any wisdom, you will fear the Most High and stay away from anything that can offend Him.
