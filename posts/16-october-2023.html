        <h1>Open Heaven 16 October 2023 TOPIC: Real Grace</h1>
        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.” – Romans 6:14 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: Titus 2:11-12 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
        
        <p>12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>There are many preachers today who say that once a person is saved, he or she is forever saved, so the fellow would go to heaven even if he or she keeps committing sin. That is a big lie. My own Bible says clearly in Romans 6:15: “What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.”</p>
        
        <p>Real grace enables you to live holy rather than permit you to commit sin. What the grace of God does is give you the ability to live above the dictates of your flesh. It is by grace that you are saved (Ephesians 2:4-5). After that, the grace of God that brought you salvation will then teach you to live holy. “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world”. This is the true work of grace that the Bible talks about.</p>
        
        <p>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. – 2 Timothy 1:9</p>
        
        <p>Please ignore anyone who tells you that the grace of God allows you to commit sin. That is a message from the devil, carefully put together to send many people to hell. The devil knows that no sinner will enter into heaven, so he carefully crafted this message for Christians to ensure that they continue to sin even after responding to the altar call, but he will fail over you, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <p>I have had big men of God argue with me over this subject and each time, I tell them, “Let us assume that you are correct, and once I have given my life to Christ before, heaven is sure even if I keep committing sin. That means if rapture takes place or we both die, we will both go to heaven. But if you are wrong, that means if rapture takes place now or we both die, I will go to heaven, and you will go to hell. Either way, I am still correct. I would rather choose the safe path”. What about you?</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Grace is the enablement to live above sin, not permission to commit it.</p>
