        <h1>Open Heaven 9 January 2024 TOPIC: It Shall Be Well 1</h1>
        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.” – Psalm 92:12 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: Isaiah 3:10 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>The old year has just passed with all its ups and downs. There is a tendency to think that things will remain the same or even become worse based on man’s projections and forecasts. However, according to our Bible reading today, I speak into your life and declare that, “It shall be well with you!”</p>
        
        <p>As assuring as this prophetic message from the Lord is, we must not lose sight of the truth embedded in our Bible reading: it is the righteous that will be singled out for wellness. Our memory verse for today affirms this as well. Beloved, I encourage you to live righteously in this new year if you want it to be well with you, your family, your business, your finances, and everything that concerns you.</p>
        
        <p>One question you might, however, be asking yourself is, “How can one be righteous in this perverse generation when the Bible says in Romans 3:23 that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God?” The answer to this question is very simple; the Bible tells us in (1 John 1:9) that if we confess our sins, God will forgive us, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, will cleanse us from all sin. Isaiah 64:6 also says:</p>
        
        <p>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>
        
        <p>The above scriptures establish the truth that we cannot cleanse ourselves and become acceptable to God by our own efforts; only the righteousness of God, which is obtainable through Jesus Christ, who died for our sins, is acceptable to God (Philippians 3:3-9).</p>
        
        <p>Truly, many forecasts have projected that the year may be challenging, but I assure you that those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under His shadow (Psalm 91:1), and they will be shielded from any evil that may be lurking ahead. The Bible, however, clearly says that God cannot behold iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13). This implies that you must have the righteousness of God through Christ if you want to access the secret place of the Most High.</p>
        
        <p>As you surrender your life to Jesus and walk in His righteousness all through this year and beyond, I decree once again that all shall be well with you.</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High will enjoy all-round well-ness for the rest of their lives.</p>

            <strong>Open Heaven 9 January 2024 HYMN 29 – When Peace Like A River Attendeth My Way</strong>
        </p>
        
        
        <p>1 When peace like a river attendeth my way,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>when sorrows like sea billows roll;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>“It is well, it is well with my soul.”</p>
        
        
        
        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>Refrain (may be sung after final stanza only):</p>
        
        
        
        <p>It is well with my soul;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>it is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
        
        
        
        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>2 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>let this blest assurance control:</p>
        
        
        
        <p>that Christ has regarded my helpless estate,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>and has shed his own blood for my soul. Refrain</p>
        
        
        
        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>3 My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!</p>
        
        
        
        <p>my sin, not in part, but the whole,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! Refrain</p>
        
        
        
        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>4 O Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>the trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>even so, it is well with my soul. Refrain</p>
