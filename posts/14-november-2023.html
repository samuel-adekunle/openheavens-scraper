        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.” – Job 1:10 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: Job 1:8-10 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>8 And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>
        
        <p>9 Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>
        
        <p>10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>I am a holiness preacher. In fact, if you were to cut me into a million pieces, each piece would keep crying, “Be holy”. The reason I keep emphasising the need to be holy is that I have seen the tremendous benefits in living a holy life. I will share some of these benefits with you today.</p>
        
        <p>First, when you are holy, you become untouchable to the devil. In Job 1:10, the devil said God had put a hedge around Job, making it impossible for him to be harmed. There is a hedge of fire around every true child of God living holy. The devil cannot harm you even if he tries. The devil tried to kill Daniel by throwing him into a den of lions. He however, failed because innocence was found in Daniel (Daniel 6:22). Throughout Jesus’ lifetime, the devil tried several times to get him killed but consistently failed because Jesus lived a holy life as we see in John 14:30 where Jesus said, “Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me”. Jesus however, surrendered His life later so as to fulfill God’s plan (John 10:17-18).</p>
        
        <p>When I was a Lecturer at the University of Lagos, one of my students came to me one day and told me she had a dream where four men pointed guns at her. When she awoke, she ran to a palm reader who told her she would die unfailingly on the 23rd of March, that year. She decided to go to a witch doctor and a so-called prophet who both said the same thing. When she told me the story, I told her, “If you give your life to Jesus, you will live and not die.” She gave her life to Jesus Christ, He washed away her sins and she left. On the 24th of March, she was still alive and I reminded her that I had told her she would not die. She however, told me that something strange happened the previous night. She said no one was able to sleep in her hostel that night as there were all sorts of strange occurrences. The spirit of death indeed came for her but couldn’t touch her because of the hedge of fire around her.</p>
        
        <p>If there is sin in your life, the devil can harm you, but when you live a holy life in Jesus, he cannot touch you.</p>

        <p>Can fulfill Thy law’s demands;</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Could my zeal no respite know,</p>

        <p>Simply to Thy cross I cling</p>

        <p>Helpless, look to Thee for grace,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Foul, I to the fountain fly;</p>

        <br />
        
        
        
        <p>4 While I draw this fleeting breath,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>When mine eyes shall close in death,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>When I soar to worlds unknown,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>See Thee on Thy judgement throne,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Rock of Ages, cleft for me,</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Let me hide myself in Thee.</p>
