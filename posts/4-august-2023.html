        <p>1 Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!That calls me from a world of care,And bids me at my Father’s throneMake all my wants and wishes known.In seasons of distress and grief,My soul has often found relief,And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!</p>
