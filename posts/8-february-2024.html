        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: 2 Timothy 2:15-21 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
        
        <p>16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
        
        <p>17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
        
        <p>18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
        
        <p>19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
        
        <p>20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
        
        <p>21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>In the Bible reading for today, the various kinds of vessels that can be found in the house of a great man were identified. It says that you will find some vessels unto honour and some unto dishonour. This may make you wonder, why does the great man keep vessels unto dishonour in his house, why doesn’t he just throw them away? This is the same question that many ask when they consider the body of Christ today. They say, “Why does God not kill all fake pastors? Why does He not expose all those who are using His name to amass wealth and fame for themselves?” The answer to that is in Matthew 13:24-30. Verses 29 and 30 in particular say:</p>
        
        <p>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
        
        <p>Our God does not act rashly; everything He does is for a reason. There are some fake pastors that some genuine Christians believe to be real. If God destroys such pastors, it could affect the faith of those who are following them. As such, the tares would have been gathered but the wheat would have unfortunately been rooted up with them. Don’t worry about the mixed multitude in the church, God is coming to separate the wheat from the tares and when He does, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
        
        <p>If you claim to be a Christian, yet you are bringing dishonour to the Lord, you better change now. If such a person refuses to change, that is not a problem. The fire that will consume him or her is getting hotter every day. Such a person can keep enjoying the benefits of being called a Christian for now, however, God is coming with the reward for such deceivers, and on that day, He will take no apologies.</p>
        
        <p>Beloved, if you are one of such deceivers, it is in your best interest to genuinely repent now, forsake your sinful ways, and truly surrender your life to Jesus Christ. It is the only way to escape the judgment that is coming for all those that are vessels unto dishonour.</p>
