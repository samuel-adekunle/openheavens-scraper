*BIBLE READING*
READ: Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 (KJV)

9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.

10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.

11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?

12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

*MESSAGE*

1 Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!that calls me from a world of care,and bids me at my Father’s thronemake all my wants and wishes known.In seasons of distress and grief,my soul has often found relief,and oft escaped the tempter’s snareby thy return, sweet hour of prayer!
