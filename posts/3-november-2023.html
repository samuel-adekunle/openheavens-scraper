        </p>
        
        <p>4 Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</p>
        
        <p>5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</p>
        
        <p>6 Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</p>
        
        <p>7 But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</p>
        
        <p>8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.</p>
        
        <p>9 Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</p>
        
        <p>10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</p>

        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>1 Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!That calls me from a world of care,And bids me at my Father’s throneMake all my want and wishes known;In seasons of distress and grief,My soul has often found relief,And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,By the return, sweet hour of prayer.</p>
