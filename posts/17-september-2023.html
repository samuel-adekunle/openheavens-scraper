        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.” – Psalm 115:3 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: Psalm 135:3-13 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>3 Praise the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.</p>
        
        <p>4 For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p>
        
        <p>5 For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.</p>
        
        <p>6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.</p>
        
        <p>7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.</p>
        
        <p>8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.</p>
        
        <p>9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.</p>
        
        <p>10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;</p>
        
        <p>11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:</p>
        
        <p>12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.</p>
        
        <p>13 Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>In Psalm 33:10-11, the Bible says that God brings the counsel of the heathen to naught but His own counsel stands forever. Thus, it doesn’t matter what your enemies have decided concerning you; He will cancel their counsel and replace them with His, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <p>The Most High can overrule doctors. In Mark 2:1-12, the man brought in through the roof could not be healed – medically speaking, but he walked out healed when he came into the presence of the Most High. We are indeed privileged to serve a God who can overrule medical reports.</p>
        
        <p>The Most High can also overrule death. In John 11:39-44, the Bible tells us that by the time Jesus got to the tomb of Lazarus, not only had Lazarus been dead for days, his corpse must also have already been stinking. His relatives believed it was already too late but the Most High spoke – completely overruling death and calling Lazarus back to life. Throughout Jesus’ earthly ministry, He never addressed death. When He was going to raise the daughter of Jairus, He didn’t use the word death at all; He said, “Little girl, arise”, and death had to let go.</p>
        
        <p>The Most High can overrule demons. Isaiah 49:24-26 shows that when the Most High decides to set free, He will feed those who say you cannot be free with their own flesh and cause them to drink their own blood. I once preached at a wedding in my village and when I saw that witches were also in attendance, I used that opportunity to praise the Most High God before them while condemning the kingdom of darkness. After the wedding, they met the bride’s mother and said, “This boy has insulted us at your daughter’s wedding; let us see if she will put to bed safely”. The mother ran to me and I told her not to worry. The bride got pregnant, and gave birth safely in spite of all the evil the witches planned because the Most High had overruled them. The Most High is saying to you now that every activity of demons in your life is overruled, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Most High God, please overrule every evil report or decision concerning me and my loved ones, in Jesus’ name.</p>
