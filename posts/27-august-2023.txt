*Open Heaven 27 August 2023 TOPIC: The Meal That Makes Rich*

*MEMORY VERSE*
MEMORISE: “And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.” – Exodus 12:36 (KJV)

*BIBLE READING*
READ: Exodus 12:15, 35-36 (KJV)

Exodus 12:1515 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

Exodus 12:35-3635 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:

36 And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

*MESSAGE*
While studying the word of God, I discovered that God performs various miracles through the Holy Communion. One of such miracles is making rich those who partake in the meal according to His will. The occult also tries to emulate this when witch doctors ask people seeking sudden riches to eat some charms that will make them rich overnight. They will however, also reach an agreement to be rich for only a few years before the charm kills them. In Yoruba land, such a person would be said to have eaten lukudi.

There was one man who ate lukudi, but instead of getting money, the charm began to eat him up from the inside. He came to the Headquarters of The Redeemed Christian Church of God and pretended to give his life to Jesus. We prayed and he vomited the charm he had eaten. After a while, we noticed that he stopped coming to Church, only to later hear that he had gone to eat the charm again. This time around the money came, but when the agreed date for his death started drawing near, he decided to run to England, and ended up dying in the plane.

As is typical with the devil, whatever he gives is always short-lived and he collects the fellow’s soul in return. Mark 8:36 asks: “What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?” With the Holy Communion however, not only will you become rich after eating it, you will also have long and eternal life.

According to Exodus 12:35-36, the day the children of Israel ate the Holy Communion, the wealth of the Egyptians was handed over to them. When you eat the Holy Communion, the wealth the Almighty God has assigned to you that is in the hands of the enemy will be transferred to you. As you eat the Holy Communion worthily, you will receive payment with interest for every unpaid labour of your life, in Jesus’ name.

There is another charm that is said to give promotion and good luck when eaten. In Yorubaland, it is known as Awure. The problem with these charms however, is that the witch doctors who prepare them are poor themselves, yet people believe they can make them prosperous. When you eat the Holy Communion however, it will bring you genuine promotion and those people who have been treating you as a servant will come and bow before you.

*PRAYER POINT*
Eating the Holy Communion worthily could be what you need to get that breakthrough you have been praying for.
