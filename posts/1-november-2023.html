        <h2>Memory Verse</h2>
        <p>MEMORISE: “There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.” – Exodus 23:26 (KJV)</p>
        <h2>Bible Reading</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>READ: Psalm 128:1-6 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>1 Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.</p>
        
        <p>2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.</p>
        
        <p>3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.</p>
        
        <p>4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.</p>
        
        <p>5 The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</p>
        
        <p>6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, and peace upon Israel.</p>
        
        <h2>Message</h2>
        
        <p>Barrenness can also be described as fruitless efforts. It could take different forms, some of which could include physical, material, academic or ministerial barrenness. I pray that the Almighty God will put an end to every form of barrenness in your life today, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <p>Physical barrenness refers to when a married couple is childless. One of my daughters was told that there was no way she could carry a child because her womb was blocked. At one of our programmes, God spoke through me that there was someone whom the doctor had said couldn’t have a child, but that the fellow would have twins. She believed the prophecy and held on to God’s word. To the glory of God, she became pregnant and went abroad to deliver through a caesarean section. To the surprise of the surgeons, she didn’t even have a womb. This was about twenty years ago. Recently, I got a phone call from this daughter of mine, and she said she wanted to bring the twins to me for a visit. I was surprised when she arrived, because she was carrying a new set of twins. The first set were now in the University and God, in His mercy, gave her another set of twins. God did what only He can do. If He could do it for that daughter of mine and you have been asking Him for a child, He will give you twins also, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <p>Material barrenness refers to when a person works tirelessly with nothing to show for it – like Peter, who fished all night and caught nothing (Luke 5:5). Thankfully, Peter accepted Jesus into his boat, obeyed the Lord’s instruction and got a net breaking catch (Luke 5:1-7).</p>
        
        <p>An example of academic barrenness is when a lecturer works very hard but can not publish papers and as a result, does not get promoted. Such people are referred to as academically barren. Ministerial barrenness can be observed when a pastor prays, fasts and evangelises but his Church does not grow.</p>
        
        <p>Whatever form barrenness might have taken in your life or in the lives of your loved ones, I declare that it shall come to an end today, in Jesus’ name.</p>
        
        <h2>Prayer Point</h2>
        <p>Pray with Deuteronomy 28:12 and personalise the declarations in it.</p>
