            <strong>READ: Jeremiah 17:5-8 (KJV)</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>5 Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.</p>
        
        <p>6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.</p>
        
        <p>7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.</p>
        
        <p>8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</p>
