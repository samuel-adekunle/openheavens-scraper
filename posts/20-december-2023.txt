*Open Heaven 20 December 2023 TOPIC: You Can’t Box God In 1*

*MEMORY VERSE*
MEMORISE: “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!” – Romans 11:33 (KJV)

*BIBLE READING*
READ: Romans 11:33-36 (KJV)

33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?

35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?

36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

*MESSAGE*
If you understand the way God works, you would have discovered that He usually does things differently from time to time. Even when He does the same thing twice, He could use a new method to do it. For example, in (2 Kings 5:1-14), He asked Naaman to go and wash in river Jordan and after he obeyed, his leprosy was cured. In Matthew 8:1-3, when He was going to heal another leper, He touched him and he was cured. In Luke 17:11-19, Jesus cleansed ten lepers, by simply saying “Go and check yourselves with the Priest”.

If you think you know how God will do something and you focus your faith and attention in that direction alone, your miracle may pass you by. That is why you have to go to Him without preconceived ideas. His ways are far higher than your ways (Isaiah 55:8-9). I don’t know how He is going to solve your own problem before the end of this year, but I know that He may not do it exactly as you have imagined it. Just listen to Him and let Him guide you.

God may not do that thing you are asking Him for instantly as you may expect. He may choose to do it gradually. He may also not do it gradually and decide to do it instantly. All you need to be assured of is that He will do it and whichever method He chooses to apply will be the best method to get it done.

Don’t try to box God in. Don’t assume that He will give you your miracle the same way He gave it to that fellow who testified in your Church. Don’t imagine the entire process in your head and then lose your miracle when things don’t go as imagined, like Naaman almost lost his. If you know the process to getting the miracle, why disturb God anyway?

If you know that you cannot do it yourself, leave the One who can do it to determine how it should be done.

Don’t box God in. I pray He will surprise you pleasantly, even before this year ends, in Jesus’ name.

*PRAYER POINT*
Don’t try to box God in; He works in mysterious ways.
