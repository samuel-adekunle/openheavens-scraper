*Open Heaven 27 November 2023 TOPIC: The Key To Influence*

*MEMORY VERSE*
MEMORISE: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” – Matthew 5:5 (KJV)

*BIBLE READING*
READ: Philippians 2:5-11 (KJV)

5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:

7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

*MESSAGE*
When Jesus died and rose again, God gave Him great influence such that at the mention of His name, every knee bows and every tongue confesses that He is Lord (Philippians 2:10-11). When you read Philippians 2:5-8 and see how Jesus Christ humbled Himself, even to the point of dying on the cross, one thing you will see clearly there is meekness – that is, being so powerful yet acting so weak for the good of others and the fulfilment of God’s will. This is what led to God exalting Him so highly and giving Him such great influence. Matthew 5:5 says: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth”. It is the meek that will inherit the earth; they are the ones who will reign and have influence on the earth.

When you look at the story of Elisha closely, you will see that he was a successful farmer who willingly became the servant of a Prophet (1 Kings 19:19-21). Because he was willing to go so low for the fulfilment of God’s agenda, God gave him so much influence that even the king of the land called him “Father” (2 Kings 13:14).

I told my children a few years ago when they asked me to talk on The Pains and Gains of Change, that one of the gains is influence. When I joined the Redeemed Christian Church of God, God told me to submit to the General Superintendent who wasn’t even educated, and I did it with all joy. When my Father-in-the-Lord later died and I was to go into full time ministry, it wasn’t a joking matter. I had known the worst kind of poverty and then worked my way through to getting a doctorate degree. I may not have been wealthy, but at least I had enough money to take care of my family and pay my bills. Now God was calling me into full time ministry to head a Church with little to no income. I went through the pain and today, at least if only in Nigeria alone, I can introduce you to many people of influence; above all, I can introduce you to the King of kings.

Influence comes with meekness. If you can genuinely submit to authority and put away all your achievements, then God will give you authority and influence.

*PRAYER POINT*
Influence comes with meekness.
